Different approach to <font color="green">Gherkin</font> features in RSpec. It is based on two premises:

1. Features are written by anyone, and need to be underdestandable by programmers.
2. Specs for Features are written by programmers and are underdestandable by computer.

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'rspec-gherkin'
end
```
