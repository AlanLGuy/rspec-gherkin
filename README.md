Different approach to Gherkin features in RSpec. It is based on two premises:

1. Features are written by *any person* for *programmers* in Gherkin.
2. Specs for them are written by *programmers* for *machine* in RSpec.

## Installation

Add to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'rspec-gherkin'
end
```
